\title{Calculates heterogeneity}
\description{Calculates heterogeneity from a frequency vector.}
\usage{H(Z)}
\arguments{ \item{Z}{Frequency vector}}
\details{This function implements Fearon's (2003) measure of heterogeneity, also known as the Herfindahl Index or the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Specify a frequency vector, which can be created using \code{prop.table}. A frequency vector describes the size of each group as a proportion of the overall population. For instance, of there are three groups in a population, A with 60% of the population, B with 30% of the population, and C with 10% of the population, the corresponding frequency vector is \code{c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)}. Heterogeneity is calculated as \eqn{H=\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_i^2}.}
